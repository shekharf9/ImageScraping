VIRTUALENV

virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments. virtualenv creates a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.

Install virtualenv via pip:

$ pip install virtualenv

Test your installation of virtualenv with command:

$ virtualenv --version


 Since the major development of the project was done with python3 and above, so to create a virtualenv with the python3.x environments run the command:

virtualenv -p python3 envname

This will generate a virtualenv with name "envname" and with python3 environments.


Once the virtualenv is created with the name envname, activate the virtualenv from the terminal with the command:

source envname/bin/activate



After activating the virtualenv, run the requirements.txt file present in the folder in the terminal to install all the dependencies and environments required for the project with the command:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

That shall install all the environments required to run this project.



FLICKR API KEYS


First, you need to create a pair of Flickr API keys by visiting https://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/. Note: A Yahoo! account is required to generate the API keys.

Flickr will generate two keys:

    A public key, which they call key
    A private key, which they call secret
